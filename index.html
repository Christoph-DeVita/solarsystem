            Neptune is the eight planet and therefore farthest planet from the Sun in our Solar System. Neptune ranks as
            the fourth-largest planet in our solar system.
            <br><br>
            It has a diameter of approximately 30600 miles (49,200 kilometres).
            <br><br>
            Neptune's orbit around the Sun takes approximately 165 Earth years to complete. It completes one rotation
            around its own axis in about 16 hours. That’s also about its day length, with 16 h and 6 min.
            <br><br>
            The Atmosphere of Neptune is composed of thick layers of hydrogen, helium, and methane.
            <br><br>
            The average temperature of Neptune is estimated at -353°F (-214°C)
            <br><br>
            Neptune consists of 14 known moons.
            <br><br>
            The elements in the Atmosphere give Neptune its vibrant blue hue.
            <br><br>
            High-speed winds mark its atmosphere. Those winds reach speeds up to 1,500 miles per hour (2,400 kilometres
            per hour).

    <div id="text-box-uranus">
        <button id="close-btn-uranus">X</button>
        <p>
            Uranus, the seventh planet from the Sun and ranks as the third-largest planet in our solar system.
            <br><br>
            It has a diameter of approximately 31500 miles (50,700 kilometres).
            <br><br>
            Uranus's orbit around the Sun takes approximately 84 Earth years to complete. However, its rotation on its
            axis is relatively rapid, completing one rotation in about 17 hours.
            <br><br>
            Uranus's most striking feature is its axial tilt, which is nearly perpendicular to its orbital plane,
            causing it to appear to roll on its side as it orbits the Sun. This unusual orientation results in extreme
            seasons, with each pole experiencing 42 years of continuous sunlight followed by 42 years of darkness.
            <br><br>
            The surface of Uranus is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, with traces of methane giving it its
            distinctive blue-green colouration.
            <br><br>
            The temperature of Uranus is estimated at 320°F (-195°C).
            <br><br>
            Uranus contains 27 known moons, each with its own unique characteristics and features.
            <br><br>
            Uranus stands out for its unique tilt and bluish-green hue.

    <div id="text-box-saturn">
        <button id="close-btn-saturn">X</button>
        <p>
            Saturn, known by many for its rings, is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest planet in our
            solar system.
            <br><br>
            The Planet has a diameter of approximately 72400 miles (ca. 116500 kilometres).
            <br><br>
            Saturn's orbit around the Sun takes approximately 29.5 Earth years to complete.
            <br><br>
            Saturn takes about 10.7 hours to rotate around its own axis, resulting in a noticeably oblate shape! The day
            length is similar, taking 10 hours and 34 min.
            <br><br>
            The atmosphere of Saturn is composed mostly of hydrogen and helium. Beneath lies a dense core of rock and
            ice, enveloped by metallic hydrogen.
            <br><br>
            The temperature of Saturn is estimated at around -216.4 °F (-138°C).
            <br><br>
            Saturn has over 80 known natural satellites orbiting the planet. Titan, its largest moon, is of particular
            interest for Scientists. This is due to its dense atmosphere and methane lakes, making it a possible target
            for future exploration and potential colonisation.
            <br><br>
            Saturn is also surrounded by rings. Those reach thousands of kilometres into space. The rings are primarily
            composed of ice and rock particles.

    <div id="text-box-jupiter">
        <button id="close-btn-jupiter">X</button>
        <p>
            Jupiter, reigns as the fifth planet from the Sun, is the largest planet in our solar system.
            With a diameter of approximately 86,881 miles (139,822 kilometres), Jupiter dwarfs all other planets,
            earning it the title of a gas giant.
            <br><br>
            Jupiter's orbit around the Sun takes around 11.86 Earth years to complete. Jupiter has a rapid rotation on
            its axis. A day on Jupiter lasts just under 10 hours, making it the fastest-spinning planet in our solar
            system.
            <br><br>
            The surface of Jupiter is composed of dense clouds of hydrogen and helium. This Cloud conceals Jupiter's
            solid core deep within.
            <br><br>
            The temperature on Jupiter is estimated at around  -162°F (-108°C). Jupiter has an impressive number of
            95 known satellites.
            <br><br>
            Jupiter's high mass exerts a gravitational pull. This pull is so powerful that it shapes the orbits of
            nearby celestial bodies significantly and even deflects potentially hazardous asteroids and comets away from
            Earth.
            <br><br>
            Jupiter has two red spots, those are due to massive impacts of other Systems, those being larger than Earth.

    <div id="text-box-mars">
        <button id="close-btn-mars">X</button>
        <p>
            Mars, the fourth planet from the Sun, is also the second-smallest planet in our Solar System (about half the
            size of Earth).
            <br><br>
            It has a diameter of roughly 6,779 kilometres (4,212 miles).
            <br><br>
            It takes around 687 Earth days to travel once around the Sun.
            <br><br>
            Mars rotates once on its axis every 24.6 Earth hours, which is also its day length!
            <br><br>
            Its surface features vast plains, towering volcanoes and the largest canyon system in the Solar System.
            <br><br>
            Mars has a thin atmosphere, mostly consisting of carbon dioxide. Temperatures vary greatly, from highs
            around 68°F (20°C) to lows of about -243°F (-153°C).
            <br><br>
            Mars has two small moons.
            <br><br>
            It's known as the “Red Planet” due to its rusty appearance. Mars experiences seasons like Earth, but they
            are longer and more extreme.
            <br><br>
            There are already numerous robotic missions studying Mars surface and atmosphere. The planet is of interest
            for future exploration and possibly colonisation (SpaceX).

    <div id="text-box-earth">
        <button id="close-btn-earth">X</button>
        <p>
            Earth, our beloved home planet, is the third planet from the Sun and the fifth-largest planet in our Solar
            System.
            It has a diameter of approximately 7900 miles (12700 kilometres).
            <br><br>
            Earth's orbit around the Sun takes approximately 365.25 days, defining the length of our calendar year. Back
            when the calendar was made, they counted as if the Earth would take 365 days to circle the Sun.
            <br><br>
            The Earth rotates on its axis, completing almost one rotation every 24 hours (23 hours m 56 minutes and 4
            Seconds to be exact).
            <br><br>
            This provides us with the day and night cycle. That's what we call a day. If we didn't add one day every 4
            years, we would fall one day behind. Which would also mean that the seasons would shift by one day each 4
            years. This is impractical. That's why we simply add 1 day to our Calendar System every 4 years (the 29. of
            February) so we don't fall behind.
            <br><br>
            The surface of Earth is characterised by vast oceans and sprawling continents. Its atmosphere is primarily
            composed of nitrogen and oxygen.
            <br><br>
            The temperature ranges from -128°F (-89°C) to 125°F (57°C).
            <br><br>
            The Earth has one big natural satellite: the moon. Due to the gravitational pull of the moon, ebb, and flow
            exist. The Moon rotates on its own axis and at the same time around the earth. Due to a “coincidence” of
            many factors (rotation speed of the moon around earth and its own axis etc.), we only see one side of the
            moon from Earth.
            <br><br>
            Earth's hot core (the centre) is very important for us humans! The Earth's core is shaped like a ball. It
            contains primarily nickel and iron. The inner part of the Ball is solid due to immense pressure. The outer
            part is a hot liquid mostly containing nickel and iron (magma). The liquid moves a lot, thus the nickel and
            iron do. This creates electric currents, which generate a magnetic field.
            <br><br>
            This field is super important for us humans! For example, it protects life on Earth from harmful solar
            radiation (deadly for humans) and cosmic particles.
            Compasses use the magnetic field of the earth. That's useful for navigation on sea, land or even in the air.

    <div id="text-box-venus">
        <button id="close-btn-venus">X</button>
        <p>
            Venus, our neighbouring planet, is the second planet in our Solar System and holds in size the sixth place
            in the Solar System
            <br><br>
            Venus has a diameter of approximately 7521 miles (12104 kilometres).
            <br><br>
            It takes Venus around 225 Earth days to rotate around the sun.
            <br><br>
            Venus has a slow rotation speed around its own axis. A light day on Venus is as long as 243 Earth days.
            <br><br>
            Its surface features vast plains, highlands, and active volcanoes. Venus is covered in thick, sulphuric acid
            clouds.
            <br><br>
            Due to this atmosphere, a very strong greenhouse effect occurs, and the temperature on the surface of Venus
            is 860°F (460°C) both during the day and night.
            <br><br>
            Venus has not a single natural moon orbiting around.
            <br><br>
            Venus has all the ingredients for life! Maybe one day, we won't see Martians but Venusians! ;-)

    <div id="text-box-mercury">

        <p>
            Mercury is in our Solar system the nearest planet to the Sun, at the same time it is the smallest planet in
            our Solar System (It would take 18 Mercury to fill Earth).
            <br><br>
            It has a diameter of 3,032 miles (4,879 km).
            <br><br>
            Mercury races superfast around the Sun, it just needs 88 Earth days.
            In the meantime, Mercury rotates slowly around its own axis.
            One solar day on Mercury takes 176 Earth days.
            <br><br>
            The surface is covered in craters and rocky terrain.
            <br><br>
            Mercury experiences extreme temperatures. Because it is so near the Sun, it can reach 806°F
            (430°C) in the day. But since it has no atmosphere which could store the temperature (energy), it
            gets as cold as -290°F (-180°C) at night.
            Mercury has no natural Satellites (no moons).
            <br><br>
            So if you visit Mercury one day, bring your Suncream and a nice blanket with you!

        <p>
            The lovely Sun, the nearest star to Earth, is also the gravitational centre of our Solar System. <br>
            In other words, all the planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune) in our Solar
            System, orbit around the Sun due to its gravitational pull.
            <br><br>
            Since 2006 Pluto is regarded as a dwarf planet and not a planet anymore,
            due to its small size, which is similar to an asteroid.
            <br><br>
            The Sun is old! Almost 4.6 billion Years old! The diameter is about 865,000 miles (c.a. 1.4 million
            kilometres). Thus, the Earth could fit more than 1.3 million times into the Sun!!
            For a star, the Sun is about average size, though they are stars 100 times bigger.
            The sun reaches up to  27,000,000°F (15,000,000°C) .
            <br><br>
            The Sun is also very, very heavy. It has such a high mass, that it holds the Earth and all the other Planets
            in our Solar System together. If you want to know more about this, you should definitely read about Kepler
            and Newton! They found out a lot of cool stuff!
            <br><br>
            In fact, the Sun is so heavy that atoms will be fused together (Hydrogen will be fused to Helium!). There is
            so much energy being freed in the fusing process, that Scientists are trying to make “a small Sun” on Earth
            to use a lot of Energy too! Theoretically, the key component they need is water!
            <br><br>
            The freed energy is what we know as light waves. The sun emits light waves. Those light waves reflect on
            objects. That's why we can see! 🙂
            <br><br>
            Should the Sun disappear, we wouldn't notice for more than 8 minutes! That's the time the light waves take
            to reach Earth.
            <br><br>
            Light waves give plants the energy to grow (Photosynthesis). So without light waves, no bread! (And no human
            lives).
            <br><br>
            Now we now know a lot about the Sun! So the next time you look up, you can impress your friends with your
            knowledge!
